I'm a technologist & business strategist with a focus on machine learning, AI, and product economics. I've advised and worked with a variety of startups in assessing and implementing data science solutions.  My current focus is on AI and NLP from both technical and economic perspectives.  I also worked for over 5 years in investment banking at Wells Fargo and in marketing analytics at Priceline.com. I have a Bachelors in Economics from Brigham Young University and I'm pursuing a Masters in Machine Learning from Columbia Unversity. 

I'm currently searching for both full-time and summer internship opportunities in consulting, finance, and technology. I'm also available as a consultant through my consulting company [Vault Economics](https://www.vaulteconomics.com)
