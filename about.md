I'm a data scientist/business strategist and machine learning student at Columbia University. I've advised and worked with a variety of startups in assessing and implementing data science solutions.  My current focus is on AI and NLP from both a technical aspect and economic implications.  I also worked for nearly 5 years in investment banking at Wells Fargo and in marketing analytics at Priceline.com. I have a BA in Economics from Brigham Young University and pursuing a MS in Machine Learning from Columbia Unversity. 

I'm currently searching for both full-time and summer internship opportunities in consulting, finance, and technology. I'm also available as a consultant through my consulting company [Vault Economics](https://www.vaulteconomics.com)
