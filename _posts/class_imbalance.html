<p><em>This is the 2<sup>nd</sup> installment of a new series called Deep Learning Research Review. Every couple weeks or so, I&rsquo;ll be summarizing and explaining research papers in specific subfields of deep learning. This week focuses on Reinforcement Learning. </em><a href="https://ad-owens.github.io/ad-owens/class_imbalance"  target="_blank"><em>Last time</em></a><em> was Generative Adversarial Networks ICYMI</em></p>
